# Tools for upgrading/downgrading a data directory from one version to another.
#
# This module is designed to accommodate both forward and backward migrations.
# Backward migrations (rollbacks) are sometimes needed if a customer runs into
# problems with a release and wishes to revert to an older version.
#
# Some guidelines for writing migration code:
#
# -	Log thoroughly.  Unlike most code, migration code is typically supervised
#	when run.  Console output is useful for seeing, e.g., which file caused the
#	migration to fail.
#
# -	Avoid parallel operations.  Being consistent and easy to follow is more
#	important here than speed.  Use Async.eachSeries, and Async.mapSeries.
#
# -	Rollbacks should not delete user data.  When migrating forward, it's
#	acceptable to delete data if it is determined that it is no longer needed.
#	Backwards migrations, however, might remove a feature that the customer was
#	using.  The data should be kept until they are able to upgrade again.
#
# - Keep migration code self-contained.  As much as possible, avoid using
#	functions from outside the migration.  Migrations code stays around
#	approximately forever, but everything around it can change.  To reduce the
#	risk of breakage and bit rot, it's best to keep migrations independent from
#	each other, and from their environment.

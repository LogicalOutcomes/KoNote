# Provides file operations implemented atomically.
#
# Normally, file operations involve many steps, and could fail part-way
# through.  The functions in this module are designed to act as if the entire
# operation is only one step -- i.e. it either succeeds 100% or leaves no trace
# that the operation was attempted.  This helps prevent application crashes and
# network problems from corrupting user data.
#
# Most operations require a `tmpDirPath`.  This directory is used as a
# temporary workspace during the operation.

#  - op: an AtomicOperation object
#
# Use `fd` to write the file contents.
# Call `op.commit` with a callback to perform the operation.

# Note: any existing file at `path` will be overwritten.

# Create files and directories inside the directory at `dirPath`, as needed.
# Calling `op.commit` will atomically move the file tree at `dirPath` to
# `path`.

# If a directory already exists at `path`, the behaviour is platform-dependent:
#
#  - On Windows, the directory will not be overwritten, and the resulting error
#    will have its code set to 'EPERM'.
#
#  - On Mac and Linux, the directory will be overwritten if and only if it is
#    empty.  Otherwise, the resulting error will have its code set to
#    'ENOTEMPTY'.
